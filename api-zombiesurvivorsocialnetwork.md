## /api/survivor/:first-survivor-id/:second-survivor-id/trade

### Trade supplies between survivors [PATCH]

To trade supplies between survivors, two survivors have to exist and they don't have to be infected. So, you can trade water, food, medication and
ammunition, but a survivor wants some supply, the another survivor have to have that amount of it. Next, the trade is made respecting a rule of points:
each supply has a amount of points like the table below:

| Item         | Points   |
|:-------------|:---------|
| 1 Water      | 4 points |
| 1 Food       | 3 points |
| 1 Medication | 2 points |
| 1 Ammunition | 1 point  |

For example, if survivor 1 has 1 water and survivor 2 has 2 medications, they can trade because (1 X 4) is equal (2 X 2), and so on.

To do this, you need patch an object with two parameters: giveToMe and receiveToYou. So, giveToMe has the supplies (name and quantity) that the
survivor 1 will receive from survivor 2 and survivor 2 will give them to survivor 1. The parameter receiveToYou is exactly the inverse.

+ Request (application/json)

        {
            "giveToMe": {
                "ammunition": 6,

            },
            "receiveToYou": {
                "water": 1,
                "medication": 4
            }
        }
